# Presentation and Design

In this folder there are few sections drawn of the design. Due to lack of time this design ONLY forms our first best approach draft to fullfill most of the criterion possible. Most of the work is done on sketch papers to come up with this design.

## Concepts behind this design

1. Keeping flat possible:
	...We minimized the height of the building to 5 floors max. Our concern was the winter sun which is narrow and present at the left bottom side of the site.
2. Functions
	...We tried to design based what we had in point cloud. If point cloud had green region (high value) for some specific function (e.g. Housing) then we decided to push that function (e.g. Housing) to that area.

In this way we combined tradional architectural approach with computer alogrithm. This could be made without no doubts better and more computational.
